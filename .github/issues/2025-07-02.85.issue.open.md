Is it worth explaining somewhere how Typst's `biblatex` crate differs from [`nom_biblatex`](https://docs.rs/nom-bibtex/latest/nom_bibtex/)?

I suppose we can look into it if you have a proposal. One fundamental difference right off the bat seems to be that `nom_bibtex` focuses on BibTeX specifically and not BibLaTeX (our main focus). Although we do aim to try to support BibTeX as a best effort where possible.

Of course, the implementation also differs (nom vs manual parsing).
