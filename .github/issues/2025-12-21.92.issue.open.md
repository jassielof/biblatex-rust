Hi,

I had no problems on current hardware but on my old Thinkpad X1 carbon gen1 (Intel i5-3427U) I'm getting a stack overflow on parsing big bib files (the bib file I've used for testing is about 2MB).

\Edit:

Tested with `biblatex v0.11.0`.

```bash
$ uname -a
Linux rosmarin 6.17.9-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon, 24 Nov 2025 15:21:09 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

As of `typst 0.14.2 (b33de9de)` typst is affected and crashes when trying to compile a file calling `#bibliography` on a big bib file.

Are other Typst versions affected, such as 0.13.0 or 0.12.0?

Yes the same crash happens with Typst 0.12.0 and 0.13.0 both pulling  biblatex v0.10.0.

the earliest version of biblatex that i could reproduce this crash with is 0.6.0. bibatex 0.5.0 doesn't crash.

Couple of things: I got back to my newer hardware today and had to realize that this happening at the same time I moved to my old machine was likely coincidence. I can reproduce the stack overflow on my newer machine as well. I had a look in gdb which suggested that the parser gets stuck in a recursive loop when trying to resolve crossrefs.

So I went looking if my bibfile is the issue. Turns out The crash is reproducible with self referential entries. So this is a minimal crashing example.

```rust
use biblatex::Bibliography;

fn main() {


    let cont = "@incollection{Hartman2022, crossref = {Hartman2022}}";

    println!("len: {}", cont.len());

    match Bibliography::parse(&cont){
        Ok(bib) => println!("Bib: {}", bib.to_bibtex_string()),
        Err(e) => println!("Nope: {}", e.to_string()),
    };

}

```

I believe the support for this kind of mechanism might have some bugs at the moment. Could you try removing these from your original bib file? (Assuming it doesn't change the output significantly)
