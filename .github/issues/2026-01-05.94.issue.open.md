# [\#94 Issue](https://github.com/typst/biblatex/issues/94) `open`: Treatment of `and others` in name lists

#### <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5488440?u=b65313e93a5033f253978827e9813c7630af3b91&v=4" width="50">[maxnoe](https://github.com/maxnoe) opened issue at [2026-01-05 14:22](https://github.com/typst/biblatex/issues/94):

BibLaTeX specifies the special "and others" entry in name lists (author, editor, ...):

> Name lists are parsed and split up into the individual items at the and delimiter.
Each item in the list is then dissected into the name part components: by
default the given name, the name prefix (von, van, of, da, de, della, …), the
family name, and the name suffix (junior, senior, …). The valid name parts
can be customised by changing the datamodel definition described in § 4.2.3.
_**Name lists may be truncated in the bib file with the keyword ‘and others’.**_
Typical examples of name lists are author and editor

From the [biblatex manual, page 15](https://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf).

This special case is currently not treated here.

@alexanderkoller proposed to raise the issue here, see discussion in pergamon: https://github.com/alexanderkoller/pergamon/issues/142


I think the right way to implement this would be to change all occurences of `Vec<Person>` to `Vec<NameListEntry>` with:

```rust
enum NameListEntry {
    Person(Person),
    AndOthers,
}
```

and add the corresponding parsing logic.
